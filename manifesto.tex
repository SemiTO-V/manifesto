\section{Vision}
SemiTO-V has the vision of a future of computing where both software and hardware are completely open source with no black boxes nor proprietary limitations. This vision is possible today thanks to the RISC-V open ISA (Instruction Set Architecture).

\section{Mission}
SemiTO-V is a student team using RISC-V ISA based cores to create custom processors, firmware, and software. We're mastering everything from RTL design to low-level software development for RISC-V platforms (RV32 and potentially RV64).

\subsection{What We Do}

\paragraph{Hardware:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Use cores based on RISC-V ISA (RV32/RV64), add custom instructions and modules
    \item Implement SoCs targeting FPGAs
    \item Optimize microarchitectures for specific workloads (ML, cryptography, DSP)
    \item Interface with peripherals, make our processors wifi-enabled.
    \item Explore advanced features such as pipelining and parallel processing (potentially for HPC)
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Software:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop/improve bare-metal firmware, RTOS (FreeRTOS) and time-sharing OS (Linux for RV64) implementations
    \item Port and optimize compilers for our processors
    \item Contribute to the software that are important for RISC-V ecosystem (Linux kernel, LLVM, vector libraries)
    \item Create our own SDKs, toolchains and simulators for our designs
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Our Approach}

\paragraph{Open Source All The Way:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item All our designs, code, and documentation live in public repos
    \item We build on and contribute back to open source RISC-V projects
    \item We document everything
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Practical Learning:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Learn by doing: Design, code, test, iterate
    \item Learn by collaborating with real sector players and getting their guidance, doing beta testing of newest RISC-V based technology
    \item Apply classroom theory by using FPGA boards, building upon open processor architectures and using low-level programming languages
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Community Focus:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Share knowledge through workshops and tutorials
    \item Collaborate with other RISC-V groups globally
    \item Bridge academia, userspace and industry through open source philosophy
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Company Focus:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Get to know the chip and RISC-V industries
    \item Beta test latest open source RISC-V products and contribute to their development (RISC-V Development Partner Program, Deepcomputing Framework ambassadorship)
    \item Share our projects with companies for evaluation
    \item Discover internship and job opportunities about RISC-V thanks to team projects
\end{itemize}
