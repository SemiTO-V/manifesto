\section{Phase 1: Kickstarting the project (May 2025 - October 2025)}
Start making an RV32 based MCU as first project of the team. Use an already made RV32 core. Build fundamental competencies and basic infrastructure.

\subsection{Hardware}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Select an RV32 core (VexRiscv/PicoRV32/NEORV32)
    \item Order a good FPGA compatible with open source toolchain and that is popular in RISC-V community (Tang Nano/ECP5/PYNQ)
    \item Order basic peripherals to test communication (Basic LCD, led, cables, VGA screen etc)
    \item Order RV32 based MCUs to play with (ESP32C6, Raspberry Pi Pico 2, CH32V003)
    \item Set up FPGA toolchain (Yosys/nextpnr)
    \item Run minimal SoC with UART/GPIO and some other interfaces
    \item Integrate SPI/I2C peripherals
    \item Implement basic DMA
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop basic bare-metal software (for already available RV32 MCUs first and then for our processor)
    \item Create basic drivers (UART, GPIO, basic LCD)
    \item Test RISC-V toolchain (GCC/LLVM) on already made RV32 MCUs and our own design on FPGA
\end{itemize}

\subsection{PR}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Make posters, t-shirts and other promotional material
    \item Prepare for recruitment efforts by opening stands around PoliTO main campus
    \item Research hackathons/competitions that we can partecipate (RISC-V Hackathon, FPGA Hackathon, Hackster.io competitions)
    \item Research and apply for events that we can attend where we can see the RISC-V industry first hand (RISC-V Summit Europe, Embedded World)
    
\end{itemize}

\section{Phase 2: Core Development (October 2025 - January 2026)}
Enhance capabilities of our RV32 based MCU.

\subsection{Hardware}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Add custom instructions
    \item Integrate more peripherals
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Port popular firmware and develop your ones
    \item Develop more complex drivers
    \item Optimize compiler flags
    \item Improve debugging workflow
\end{itemize}

\subsection{PR}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Accelerate recruitment efforts by opening stands around PoliTO main campus, show live software demos running on RV32 MCUs
    \item Get in contact with RISC-V companies, apply for beta testings of their products and get their advice for the team
    \item Get in contact with RISC-V International, apply for their programs
    \item Organize workshops and talks about RISC-V. Invite influential people with companies/organizations to the campus.
\end{itemize}

\section{Phase 3: Advanced Features (January 2026 - May 2026)}
Expand functionality

\subsection{Hardware}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Further develop peripheral interface (Connect sensors and modules like DAC, connect to WiFi/Buetooth with external MCUs such as ESP32C6)
    \item Enhance interrupt controller
    \item Benchmark with other RV32 MCUs such as ESP32C6, ESP32P4 and Pi Pico 2
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Develop custom SDK
    \item Contribute to GCC/LLVM compatibility for RV32
    \item Create demo applications that push the limits of the CPU
\end{itemize}

\subsection{PR}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Research companies in RV32 market, invite their CEOs to give talks in school
    \item Research and apply for events that we can attend where we showcase our projects (RISC-V Summit Demo Day, Embedded World, Maker Faire)
    \item Organize workshops with people from HW and SW departments
    \item Make posters, t-shirts and other promotional material
    \item Continue recruitment efforts, put our projects (FPGAs with our designs etc) on table, doing live demos and benchmark tests
\end{itemize}

\section{Phase 4: Final stage (May 2026 - October 2026)}
Prepare for next steps

\subsection{Hardware}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Finalize RV32 SoC design
    \item Send it to other student teams by explaining the functionality so they can beta test it in their own projects (PoliTek music circuits, RoboTO robots' brain etc)
    \item Research RV64 extensions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Complete documentation
    \item Ensure reproducible builds
    \item Research RV64 ecosystem
\end{itemize}

\subsection{PR and Team Lead}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Research and apply for more events
    \item Keep in touch with companies in RV32 market
    \item Plan Year 2 roadmap and projects by discussing with all active members, very likely inclining to RV64 and Linux for RISC-V ecosystem
    \item Plan recruitment and role assignment efforts for the next project
\end{itemize}
